## <i class="fas fa-boxes"></i> Package releases

Original version was `FATE-HD`, developed and used in papers such as *Boulangeat 2014*, *Barros 2017* or *Carboni 2018* (see [FATE tutorial - Publications](fate_tutorial_0_publications.html)). It was only `C++` code, and all modules were linked together (`LIGHT`, `DISPERSAL`, `HABSUIT`, `SEEDING`, `DISTURBANCE`).

Refinements to the model, and integration of the `C++` code within an `R` package, as well as new modules development, were meant to facilitate the use and spread of the `FATE` model.

#### Version 1.0.0

- all steps included in one tool (`PRE-FATE`, `FATE`, `POST-FATE`), that can be easily installed on all OS (Mac, Unix, Windows)
- a simplification of some structural equations of the model (see [FATE tutorial - Modelling framework](fate_tutorial_0_modelling_framework.html))
- 8 modules that can be turned on/off (see [FATE tutorial - Modules](fate_tutorial_3_MODULES.html))
- a `shiny` interface for those who prefer to visually explore the parameters (see [SHINY interface](interface_tutorial_0_presentation.html) page)
- a complete documentation and manual, with meaningful examples from real dataset (see [Manual & Examples](manual.html) page)
