\title{Computation of distances between species based on traits and niche 
overlap}
\usage{
PRE_FATE.speciesDistance(
  mat.traits,
  mat.overlap,
  opt.maxPercent.NA = 0,
  opt.maxPercent.similarSpecies = 0.25,
  opt.min.sd = 0.3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat.traits}{a \code{data.frame} with at least 3 columns :
\describe{
\item{\code{species}}{the ID of each studied species}
\item{\code{GROUP}}{a factor variable containing grouping information to 
divide the species into data subsets (see 
\href{PRE_FATE.speciesDistance#details}{\code{Details}})}
\item{\code{...}}{one column for each functional trait}
}}

\item{mat.overlap}{two options :
\itemize{
  \item a \code{data.frame} with 2 columns :
  \describe{
    \item{\code{species}}{the ID of each studied species}
    \item{\code{raster}}{path to raster file with species distribution}
  }
  \item a dissimilarity structure representing the niche overlap between 
  each pair of species. \cr It can be a \code{dist} object, a 
  \code{niolap} object, or simply a \code{matrix}.
}}

\item{opt.maxPercent.NA}{(\emph{optional}) default \code{0}. \cr Maximum 
percentage of missing values (\code{NA}) allowed for each trait (between 
\code{0} and \code{1})}

\item{opt.maxPercent.similarSpecies}{(\emph{optional}) default \code{0.25}. 
\cr Maximum percentage of similar species (same value) 
allowed for each trait (between \code{0} and \code{1})}

\item{opt.min.sd}{(\emph{optional}) default \code{0.5}. \cr Minimum 
standard deviation allowed for each trait (trait unit)}
}
\value{
A \code{dist} object corresponding to the distance between each pair 
of species, or a \code{list} of \code{dist} objects, one for each
\code{GROUP} value. \cr \cr

The information is written in \file{PRE_FATE_DOMINANT_speciesDistance.csv} 
file (or if necessary, one file is created for each group).
}
\description{
This script is designed to create a distance matrix between 
species, combining functional distances (based on functional trait values) 
and niche overlap (based on co-occurrence of species).
}
\details{
This function allows to obtain a \strong{distance matrix between species}, 
based on two types of distance information :

\enumerate{
  \item{\strong{Functional traits : }}{
  \itemize{
    \item The \code{GROUP} column is required if species must be separated 
    to have one final distance matrix per \code{GROUP} value. \cr If the 
    column is missing, all species will be considered as part of a unique 
    dataset.
    \item The traits can be qualitative or quantitative, but previously 
    identified as such \cr (i.e. with the use of functions such as 
    \code{as.numeric}, \code{as.factor} and \code{ordered}).
    \item Functional distance matrix is calculated with Gower dissimilarity, 
    using the \code{\link[FD]{gowdis}} function.
    \item This function allows \code{NA} values. \cr However, too many 
    missing values lead to misleading results. Hence, 3 parameters allow the 
    user to play with the place given to missing values, and therefore the 
    selection of traits that will be used for the distance computation :
    \describe{
      \item{opt.maxPercent.NA}{traits with too many missing values are 
      removed}
      \item{opt.maxPercent \cr .similarSpecies}{traits with too many 
      similar values are removed}
      \item{opt.min.sd}{traits with too little variability are removed}
    }
  }
  }
  \item{\strong{Niche overlap : }}{
  \itemize{
    \item If a \code{data.frame} is given, the degree of niche overlap will 
    be computed using the \code{\link[phyloclim]{niche.overlap}}. \cr \cr \cr
  }
  }
}

Functional distances and niche overlap informations are then 
\strong{combined} according to the following formula :

\deqn{\text{mat.DIST}_{sub-group} = \frac{[ \text{mat.OVERLAP}_{sub-group} +
\text{mat.FUNCTIONAL}_{sub-group} * n_{traits} ]}{[ n_{traits} + 1 ]}}

meaning that \strong{distance matrix obtained from functional information 
is weighted by the number of traits used}.

\examples{

## Load example data
data(DATASET_Bauges_PFG)

## Species traits
tab.traits = DATASET_Bauges_PFG$dom.traits
str(tab.traits)

## Species niche overlap (similarity distance)
tab.overlap = DATASET_Bauges_PFG$dom.dist_overlap
tab.overlap[1:5, 1:5]

## Give warnings -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
sp.DIST = PRE_FATE.speciesDistance(mat.traits = tab.traits
                                   , mat.overlap = as.matrix(tab.overlap))
str(sp.DIST)

\dontrun{
require(foreach)
require(ggplot2)
require(ggdendro)
pp = foreach(x = names(sp.DIST)) \%do\%
{
  hc = hclust(sp.DIST[[x]])
  pp = ggdendrogram(hc, rotate = TRUE) +
    labs(title = paste0("Hierarchical clustering based on species distance "
                        , ifelse(length(names(sp.DIST)) > 1
                        , paste0("(group ", x, ")")
                        , "")))
  return(pp)
}
plot(pp[[1]])
plot(pp[[2]])
plot(pp[[3]])

## Change parameters to allow more NAs (and change traits used) ------------------------------
sp.DIST = PRE_FATE.speciesDistance(mat.traits = tab.traits
                                   , mat.overlap = as.matrix(tab.overlap)
                                   , opt.maxPercent.NA = 0.05
                                   , opt.maxPercent.similarSpecies = 0.3
                                   , opt.min.sd = 0.3)
