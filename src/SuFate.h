	 *
	 * For light :
	 * Light resources are calculated per stratum, according to the FG
	 * abundances and the thresholds defined in the GSP object :
	 * LIGHT_THRESH_MEDIUM and LIGHT_THRESH_LOW.
	 * If the cumulated abundance in one stratum is superior to one of these
	 * thresholds, the light resources in the stratum below will decrease.
	 * It is impossible to have more light in one stratum than in the upper
	 * stratum.
	 *
	 * For Soil :
	 * The soil condition is linked to the relative importance of each PFG
	 * within the pixel. It is calculated as the weighted mean of each
	 * theoretical maximum contribution of each PFG to soil resources.

	 * For light :
